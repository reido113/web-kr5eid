    <h1>Unfiltered Blahh</h1>
    <h3>This is just a place to throw down some Raw shit that folks are usually reluctant to say.<br>
    There are no links to this file. Happy Easter<br>
    I will most likely just delete this shit because it is too dramatic...</h3>

      <h2></h2>
      <h2>Connecting an internet device to a repeater network that is thousands of miles away is really not all that impressive.</h2>
      I mean, maybe these toys could be useful for passing traffic during an emergency... Surely useful for an occassional quick howdy to a distant Friend or Family member. But — pfft — Stick to your silly social media accounts or cell phones for the long winded crap. Or, better yet, just get your HF on.<br>
      <br>
      The following paragraph needs some serious work in the "Flow" department... It highlights an ignorance regarding this, however, it is somewhat of a personal rant of a particular situation.<br>
      I'm leaving it 'as is' while I make the adjustments over time.<br>
      <br>
      The only reason that someone would consistently tie up a distant well established extensive repeater network (especially during the wee hours of the morning) is due to their Ignorance and Trolling.<br>
      <br>
      Ignorance meaning that they choose to turn a blind eye to their annoyance.<br>
      Trolling meaning that what is really being sought out is any kind of rise, or, response from a station that makes any mention of the annoyance.<br>
      In essence — said station lacks any real content, and thus, they just try to bait others into combative discussions. All while remaining Ignorant to the fact that everyone really finds them annoying. They thrive on this shit.<br>
      If you are said nimbisul, pfft... You know exactly what your doing, and others do too. You're boring and lack content un perdidor.<br>
      <br>
      What does this really effect... An entire coastline of radio operators who love to monitor during the overnight hours. Most likely in case an urgency is called.<br>
      These dedicated individuals are forced to turn off their radios because of this self centered hubub.<br>
      <br>
      Why in the world any local operator would continue to engage in this nonsense is seemingly more senseless.<br>
      They are mearly only inflicting damage upon something that is near and close to them. Shitting in their own backyard...<br>
      This also highlights a retardedness that is created by folks who give false positive assurance.<br>
      <br>
      These users prevent an entire network of good intentioned individuals from being able to respond if an emergency were to occur.<br>
      <br>

      ...and please, spare The World from your "But this band is open for everyone to use. You can't tell me I can't be here" crap...ugh...<br>
