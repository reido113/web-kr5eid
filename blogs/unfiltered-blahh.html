      <h2>Connecting an internet capeable device to a repeater network that is thousands of miles away is not all that impressive.</h2>
      Maybe these toys can be entertaining or potentially useful for passing traffic during an emergency — However – Stick to the silly social media accounts or cell phones for this kinda crap.<br>
      <br>
      The following paragraph needs some serious work in the "Flow" department... It highlights an ignorance regarding this, however, it is somewhat a rant of a particular situation.<br>
      I'm leaving it as is while I make adjustments over time.<br>
      <br>
      The only reason someone would consistently tie up a distant extensive well established repeater network (**getting particular here** 'in the wee hours of the morning') by connecting<br>
      via an internet capeable device is because of Ignorance and/or Trolling.<br>
      <br>
      Ignorance meaning they choose to turn a blind eye to their annoyance.<br>
      Trolling meaning that what is really being sought after is for someone to speak up and tell them how annoying and sensless they actually are. All in an attempt to have something to whine and complain about.<br>
      In essence — an attention whore who lacks any real content and thus must try to bait others into combat. They thrive on this and at the same time are Ignorant to the fact that everyone really finds them annoying.<br>
      If you are said nimbisul, pfft... You know exactly what your doing, and others do too. You're boring and lack content.<br>
      <br>
      An entire coastline of radio operators love to monitor during the overnight hours. Most likely in case an urgency is called.<br>
      These dedicated individuals are forced to turn off their radios because of this self centered hubub.<br>
      <br>
      Why in the world any local operator would continue to engage in this nonsense is seemingly more senseless.<br>
      They are mearly damaging something that is near and close to them.<br>
      This highlights the retardedness created by folks who give false positive assurance.<br>
      <br>
      These users prevent an entire network of good intentioned individuals from being able to respond if an emergency were to occur.<br>
      <br>

      ...and please, spare The World from your "But this band is open for everyone to use. You can't tell me I can't be here" crap...ugh...<br>
